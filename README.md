RLCard is a toolkit for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in card games. It supports multiple card environments with easy-to-use interfaces for implementing various reinforcement learning and searching algorithms. The goal of RLCard is to bridge reinforcement learning and imperfect information games. RLCard is developed by [DATA Lab](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/) at Texas A&M University and community contributors.

## Installation
Make sure that you have **Python 3.6+** and **pip** installed. We recommend installing the stable version of `rlcard` with `pip`:

```
pip3 install rlcard
```
The default installation will only include the card environments. To use PyTorch implementation of the training algorithms, run
```
pip3 install rlcard[torch]
```
Alternatively, you can clone the latest version with:
```
git clone https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.git
```
or only clone one branch to make it faster:
```
git clone -b master --single-branch --depth=1 https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.git
```
Then install with
```
cd rlcard
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install -e .[torch]
```

We also provide [**conda** installation method](https://anaconda.org/toubun/rlcard):

```
conda install -c toubun rlcard
```

Conda installation only provides the card environments, you need to manually install Pytorch on your demands.

## Examples
A **short example** is as below.

```python
import rlcard
from rlcard.agents import RandomAgent

print(env.num_actions) # 2
print(env.num_players) # 1
print(env.state_shape) # [[2]]
print(env.action_shape) # [None]

env = rlcard.make('blackjack')
env.set_agents([RandomAgent(num_actions=env.num_actions)])

trajectories, payoffs = env.run()
```

RLCard can be flexibly connected to various algorithms. See the following examples:

*   [Playing with random agents](docs/toy-examples.md#playing-with-random-agents)
*   [Deep-Q learning on Blackjack](docs/toy-examples.md#deep-q-learning-on-blackjack)
*   [Training CFR (chance sampling) on Leduc Hold'em](docs/toy-examples.md#training-cfr-on-leduc-holdem)
*   [Having fun with pretrained Leduc model](docs/toy-examples.md#having-fun-with-pretrained-leduc-model)
*   [Training DMC on Dou Dizhu](docs/toy-examples.md#training-dmc-on-dou-dizhu)
*   [Evaluating Agents](docs/toy-examples.md#evaluating-agents)

## Demo
Run `examples/human/leduc_holdem_human.py` to play with the pre-trained Leduc Hold'em model. Leduc Hold'em is a simplified version of Texas Hold'em. Rules can be found [here](docs/games.md#leduc-holdem).

## Available Environments
We provide a complexity estimation for the games on several aspects. **InfoSet Number:** the number of information sets; **InfoSet Size:** the average number of states in a single information set; **Action Size:** the size of the action space. **Name:** the name that should be passed to `rlcard.make` to create the game environment. We also provide the link to the documentation and the random example.

## API Cheat Sheet
### How to create an environment
You can use the the following interface to make an environment. You may optionally specify some configurations with a dictionary.
*   **env = rlcard.make(env_id, config={})**: Make an environment. `env_id` is a string of a environment; `config` is a dictionary that specifies some environment configurations, which are as follows.
	*   `seed`: Default `None`. Set a environment local random seed for reproducing the results.
	*   `allow_step_back`: Defualt `False`. `True` if allowing `step_back` function to traverse backward in the tree.
	*   Game specific configurations: These fields start with `game_`. Currently, we only support `game_num_players` in Blackjack, .

Once the environemnt is made, we can access some information of the game.
*   **env.num_actions**: The number of actions.
*   **env.num_players**: The number of players.
*   **env.state_shape**: The shape of the state space of the observations.
*   **env.action_shape**: The shape of the action features (Dou Dizhu's action can encoded as features)

### What is state in RLCard
State is a Python dictionary. It consists of observation `state['obs']`, legal actions `state['legal_actions']`, raw observation `state['raw_obs']` and raw legal actions `state['raw_legal_actions']`.

### Basic interfaces
The following interfaces provide a basic usage. It is easy to use but it has assumtions on the agent. The agent must follow [agent template](docs/developping-algorithms.md). 
*   **env.set_agents(agents)**: `agents` is a list of `Agent` object. The length of the list should be equal to the number of the players in the game.
*   **env.run(is_training=False)**: Run a complete game and return trajectories and payoffs. The function can be used after the `set_agents` is called. If `is_training` is `True`, it will use `step` function in the agent to play the game. If `is_training` is `False`, `eval_step` will be called instead.

### Advanced interfaces
For advanced usage, the following interfaces allow flexible operations on the game tree. These interfaces do not make any assumtions on the agent.
*   **env.reset()**: Initialize a game. Return the state and the first player ID.
*   **env.step(action, raw_action=False)**: Take one step in the environment. `action` can be raw action or integer; `raw_action` should be `True` if the action is raw action (string).
*   **env.step_back()**: Available only when `allow_step_back` is `True`. Take one step backward. This can be used for algorithms that operate on the game tree, such as CFR (chance sampling).
*   **env.is_over()**: Return `True` if the current game is over. Otherewise, return `False`.
*   **env.get_player_id()**: Return the Player ID of the current player.
*   **env.get_state(player_id)**: Return the state that corresponds to `player_id`.
*   **env.get_payoffs()**: In the end of the game, return a list of payoffs for all the players.
*   **env.get_perfect_information()**: (Currently only support some of the games) Obtain the perfect information at the current state.
