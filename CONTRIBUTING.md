## Roadmaps

*   **Human-Bot Visualization.** Develop GUI for human interactions (currently we only support terminal-based GUI)
*   **Analysis Tools.** Develop tools to visualize the decisions of the agents.
*   **Rule-based Agent and Pre-trained Models.** Provide more rule-based agents and pre-trained models to benchmark the evaluation (currently we only support Leduc Hold'em and UNO)
*   **Leaderboard.** Develop a platform that enables everyone to upload his/her trained model and compete with each other worldwide.
*   **More Games and Algorithms.** Develop more games and algorithms.
