        ''' Initialize the round class

            The round class maintains the following instances:
                1) dealer: the dealer of the round; dealer has stock_pile and discard_pile
                2) players: the players in the round; each player has his own hand_pile
                3) current_player_id: the id of the current player who has the move
                4) is_over: true if the round is over
                5) going_out_action: knock or gin or None
                6) going_out_player_id: id of player who went out or None
                7) move_sheet: history of the moves of the player (including the deal_hand_move)

            The round class maintains a list of moves made by the players in self.move_sheet.
            move_sheet is similar to a chess score sheet.
            I didn't want to call it a score_sheet since it is not keeping score.
            I could have called move_sheet just moves, but that might conflict with the name moves used elsewhere.
            I settled on the longer name "move_sheet" to indicate that it is the official list of moves being made.
