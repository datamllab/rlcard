#   [] Why no_bid_action_id in bidding_rep ?
#       It allows the bidding always to start with North.
#       If North is not the dealer, then he must call 'no_bid'.
#       Until the dealer is reached, 'no_bid' must be the call.
#       I think this might help because it keeps a player's bid in a fixed 'column'.
#       Note: the 'no_bid' is only inserted in the bidding_rep, not in the actual game.
#
#   [] Why current_player_rep ?
#       Explanation here.
#
#   [] Note: hands_rep maintain the hands by N, E, S, W.
#
#   [] Note: trick_rep maintains the trick cards by N, E, S, W.
#      The trick leader can be deduced since play is in clockwise direction.
#
#   [] Note: is_bidding_rep can be deduced from bidding_rep.
#      I think I added is_bidding_rep before bidding_rep and thus it helped in early testing.
#      My early testing had just the player's hand: I think the model conflated the bidding phase with the playing phase in this situation.
#      Although is_bidding_rep is not needed, keeping it may improve learning.
#
#   [] Note: bidding_rep uses the action_id instead of one hot encoding.
#      I think one hot encoding would make the input dimension significantly larger.
