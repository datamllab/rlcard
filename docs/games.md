# Blackjack
Blackjack is a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One. The objective is to beat the dealer by reaching a higher score than the dealer without exceeding 21. In the toolkit, we implement a simple version of Blackjack. In each round, the player only has two options: "hit" which will take a card, and 'stand' which end the turn. The player will "bust" if his hands exceed 21 points.
## State Encoding
In this toy environment, we encode the state as an array `[player_score, dealer_score]` where `player_score` is the score currently obtained by the player, and the `dealer_score` is derived from the card that faces up from the dealer.
## Action Encoding
There are two actions in the simple Blackjack. They are encoded as follows:
| Action ID                     | Action  |
| ------------------------ |:--------------|
| 0 | hit |
| 1 | stand |
