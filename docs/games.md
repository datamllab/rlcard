# Blackjack
Blackjck is a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One. The objective is to beat the dealer by reaching higher score than the dealer without exceeding 21. In the toolkit, we implement a simple version of Blackjack. In each round, the player only has two options: "hit" which will take a card, and 'stand' which end the turn. The player will "bust" if his hands exceed 21 points.
