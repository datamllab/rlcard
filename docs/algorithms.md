# Deep-Q Learning
Deep-Q Learning (DQN) is a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. We wrap DQN as an example to show how RL algorithms can be connected to the environments. In the DQN agent, the following classes are implemented:
* `DQNAgent`: The agent class that interacts with the environment.
* `Normalizer`: The responsibility of this class is to keep a running mean and std. The Normalizer will first preprocess the state before feeding the state into the model.
* `Memory`: A memory buffer that manages the storing and sampling of transitions.
* `Estimator`: The neural network that is used to make predictions.

# DeepCFR
Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (DeepCFR) is a state-of-the-art framework for solving imperfect-information games.
We wrap DeepCFR as an example to show how state-of-the-art framework can be connected to the environments. In the DeepCFR, the following classes are implemented:
* `DeepCFR`: The DeepCFR class that interacts with the environment.
* `Fixed Size Ring Buffer`: A memory buffer that manages the storing and sampling of transitions.
