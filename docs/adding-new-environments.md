# Adding New Environments
To add a new environment to the toolkit, generally you should take the following steps:
* **Implement a game.** Card games usually have similar structures so that they can be implemented with `Game`, `Round`, `Dealer`, `Judger`, `Player` as in existing games. The easiest way is to inherit the classed in [rlcard/core.py](rlcard/core.py) and implement the functions.
* **Wrap the game with an environment.** The easiest way is to inherit `Env` in [rlcard/envs/env.py](rlcard/env/env.py). You need to implement `extract_state` which encodes the state, `decode_action` which decode actions from the id to the text string, and `get_payoffs` which calculate payoffs of the players.
* **Register the game.** Now it is time to tell the toolkit where to locate the new environment. Go to [rlcard/envs/__init__.py](rlcard/envs/__init__.py), and indicate the name of the game and its entry point.

To test whether the new environment is set up successfully:
```python
import rlcard
env.make(#the new evironment#)
```
